### AANADEMU, a co-processing Numerical Analysis dedicated MCU

Aerendir Mobile Inc. is proposing to design a very advanced analytical co-processing micro controller unit aimed to solve for
instance, Singular Value Decomposition problems (SVD) using code that has been generalized and optimized for High Level Synthesis. 

SVD is a Linear Algebra technique that decomposes matrices into 2, 3 or more component sub-matrices (factorization).
SVD has numerous important applications in signal processing, statistics, biology (DNA, protein structures, epidemic outbreaks…),
molecular dynamics, quantum physics, but also in large datasets analysis in order to reduce complexity (stock markets…), and in
Machine Learning (Internet recommender systems, training, digital speech or image processing…).  SVD can simplify problems by
providing for lower rank equivalent matrices.

The decomposition of matrices improves computation run-time and decreases complexity of large scale problems, bringing this
technique to ASIC at 130 nm will aim at achieving higher throughputs (ie. SVD’s per second and SVD’s/second/surface unit)
than the existing solutions, and will form the basis of Advanced Numerical engines.
